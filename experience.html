    <h2>Framatome</h2>
    <h4>May, 2021 - Anticipated May, 2022</h4>
    <p>Framatome is a global leader in nuclear energy technology. Information about Framatome can be found <a href="https://www.framatome.com/EN/home-57/index.html">here</a>. Extensive use of codes are required for analysis of thermal hydrualic events in the reactor core. Starting in May of 2021, I worked in the Core T-H division where engineers study these events. I developed a code called pow3DCreator that generated POWER3D files (a file representing fuel rods in the core). Before pow3DCreator, engineers would create one-time use scripts to transform data, as input from clients is not in the same format. pow3DCreator is capable of transforming multiple client data types into a clean, usable POWER3D file.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lead developer of certified pow3DCreator code for heat flux calculations in the nuclear core.</li>
        <li>Responsible for codes in development cycle including requirements, testing, and release.</li>
        <li>Performed user diagnostics to provide nuclear engineers with relevant tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ASK</h2>
    <h4>May, 2019 - August, 2020</h4>
    <p>ASK is an application and cybersecurity contractor in Lansing, Michigan. During the summers of 2019 and 2020, I interned in the Enhanced Security Services division under Joshua Gembala. Information about ASK can be found <a href="https://justask.net/">here</a>. During the summer of 2019, I created a risk assemsment managment suite called RAM. The application ran with Electron (yes, lots of overhead but speedy development) and web languages.
        During the summer of 2020, I worked from home on a variety of scripts to assist in organizing outputs of security applications such as Nessus and Pentest into one clean Excel spreadsheet, organized by various criteria. This was performed with C++ for max performance.
